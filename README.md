# Build

### 1. Singleplayer 

To **specify which ships you would like** to have in the singleplayer game, please configure the **`config/battleships.txt`** file.  
Example file: 
```
s1:1
s2:3
s3:4
s4:2
```
This configuration will place 4 ships on the board, of sizes 1, 3, 4, and 2 respectively.

### 2. Against AI opponent

In order to **specify your ship placement** when playing against the AI opponent, please configure the **`config/placements.json`** file.  
Example file:
```

```
